# BEA Pumpkin Pi - AWS Lambda Requirements
#
# This skill uses ONLY Python standard library for AWS Lambda compatibility.
# No external dependencies required for production deployment.
#
# The code is optimized for AWS Lambda Python 3.9 runtime with zero external packages.
# This ensures fast cold starts and no dependency conflicts.

# No requirements - Pure Python standard library only!

# Standard library imports used (already included in Python 3.9):
# - json (JSON parsing for Alexa requests/responses)
# - random (Random number generation for emotional variations)
# - time (Timestamp generation for performance tracking)
# - math (Mathematical operations for BEA calculations)
# - typing (Type hints for code clarity)
# - datetime (Timestamp handling with timezone support)

# For local development/testing only (optional):
# pytest>=7.0.0  # For running unit tests
# black>=22.0.0  # For code formatting
# mypy>=0.950    # For type checking
